TechAI Assistant - Final Vercel-ready frontend bundle

How to deploy:
1. Create a GitHub repo and push these files (or upload the ZIP in Vercel's import/upload).
2. In Vercel, import the repo. Framework: Vite. Build command: npm run build. Output dir: dist.
3. The app is mobile-optimized. Open on a phone and 'Add to Home Screen' to install as a PWA.
4. Admin quick-code is 'admin-secret' for demo only. Replace with a secure backend-auth flow in production.
